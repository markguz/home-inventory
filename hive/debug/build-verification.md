# Build Verification Report

**Date**: 2025-10-31 19:00 EST
**Status**: ✅ **FIXES CONFIRMED IN BUILD**

## Executive Summary

All code changes have been successfully compiled into the production build. Both the confidence threshold reduction and image downscaling improvements are present and active in the compiled JavaScript.

---

## 1. minItemConfidence Fix Status

### Source Code
- **File**: `/home-inventory/src/features/receipt-processing/services/parser.service.ts`
- **Line**: 12
- **Value**: `0.2` (lowered from 0.6)
- **Comment**: "Lowered from 0.6 - real-world receipt OCR produces ~30-50% confidence"
- **Last Modified**: 2025-10-31 18:29:18

### Compiled Build
- **File**: `.next/server/chunks/[root-of-the-server]__0386afd8._.js`
- **Value Found**: `minItemConfidence:.2`
- **Build Time**: 2025-10-31 19:00:18
- **Status**: ✅ **CORRECT** - Value is 0.2 in compiled code

### Verification Command
```bash
grep -o "minItemConfidence[^,}]*" \
  .next/server/chunks/[root-of-the-server]__0386afd8._.js
```

**Output**: `minItemConfidence:.2`

## 2. Image Downscaling Fix Status

### Source Code
- **File**: `/home-inventory/src/lib/services/image-preprocessor.ts`
- **Lines**: 90-100
- **Feature**: High-resolution (2000+ width) images downscaled to 0.5x
- **Log Message**: "Downscaling high-resolution image (0.5x)"

### Compiled Build
- **File**: `.next/server/chunks/[root-of-the-server]__0386afd8._.js`
- **Code Found**: YES - "downscale-hi-res" string present
- **Status**: ✅ **PRESENT** - Downscaling code is in compiled bundle

### Verification Command
```bash
grep "downscale-hi-res" \
  .next/server/chunks/[root-of-the-server]__0386afd8._.js
```

**Output**: String found at line 647

## 5. Verification Evidence

### Evidence 1: Confidence Threshold
```javascript
// Found in compiled code:
minItemConfidence:.2
```

### Evidence 2: Downscaling Logic
```javascript
// Found in compiled code:
console.log('[OCR Preprocess] Downscaling high-resolution image (0.5x)');
applied.push('downscale-hi-res');
```

### Evidence 3: Build Freshness
- Build ID: `3i8arLipu2LFikJDMktru`
- All chunks: Oct 31 19:00 (current)
- Source files: Oct 31 18:29
- **Gap**: 31 minutes (build is AFTER source changes)

## 6. What This Means

### For Receipt Processing
1. **Lower Confidence Items Will Be Captured**
   - Old threshold: 60% confidence required
   - New threshold: 20% confidence required
   - More OCR text will be processed as potential items

2. **High-Res Images Will Be Optimized**
   - Images over 2000px width will be downscaled 0.5x
   - Should improve OCR accuracy
   - Reduces processing time

### Expected Behavior Changes
- More line items detected per receipt
- Better handling of poor quality receipts
- Improved OCR on high-resolution phone photos
- Console logs will show downscaling messages

---

## 7. Next Steps for Testing

### Test Commands
```bash
# Start the app
npm run dev

# Upload test receipt
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/receipts/process \
  -F "file=@sample_receipt.jpg"

# Check logs for:
# - "[OCR Preprocess] Downscaling high-resolution image (0.5x)"
# - Items with confidence between 0.2 and 0.6
```

### What to Monitor
1. **Console Output**: Look for downscaling messages
2. **Extracted Items**: Count should increase
3. **Item Confidence**: Should see values < 0.6
4. **Processing Time**: May improve for large images

---

## 8. Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ **ALL FIXES VERIFIED IN BUILD**

Both code changes are:
- ✅ Present in source code
- ✅ Compiled into build chunks
- ✅ Build timestamp is AFTER source changes
- ✅ Ready for testing

The application is now ready to process receipts with the new, more lenient confidence thresholds and improved image preprocessing.
