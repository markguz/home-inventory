# Organizing Items

Learn how to effectively organize your inventory using categories, locations, and tags.

## Organization Methods

### 1. Categories (What kind of thing?)
- **🏠 Home**: Furniture, electronics, appliances, decorations
- **🔧 Garage**: Tools, equipment, sports gear, seasonal items
- **🚗 Automobile**: Vehicles, parts, accessories

### 2. Locations (Where is it?)
Create hierarchical locations:
\`\`\`
House
├── First Floor
│   ├── Living Room
│   ├── Kitchen
│   │   ├── Pantry
│   │   └── Cabinets
│   └── Dining Room
├── Second Floor
│   ├── Master Bedroom
│   └── Office
└── Basement

Garage
├── Workbench Area
├── Tool Cabinet
└── Overhead Storage
\`\`\`

### 3. Tags (How else to group?)
Multiple tags per item for flexible organization:
- **Status**: "Needs Repair", "For Donation", "For Sale"
- **Value**: "High Value", "Collectibles"
- **Usage**: "Daily Use", "Seasonal", "Holiday Items"
- **Projects**: "Renovation 2024", "Moving - Box 1"
- **Ownership**: "Personal", "Shared", "Work"

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple**, add detail later
2. **Be consistent** with naming conventions
3. **Use all three methods** together
4. **Think about retrieval** - organize for finding items
5. **Review regularly** to keep current

## Example: Moving House

1. Create tags: "Box 1", "Box 2", "Unpack First"
2. Tag items as you pack
3. After move, update locations and remove tags
